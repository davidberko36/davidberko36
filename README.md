# 👋 Hey there, I’m David

> _"Just a curious developer, always learning. Nothing... extraordinary."_ 😉

## 🧭 About Me

I'm a Computer Science major exploring the worlds of web development, data, and systems — with a particular interest in fast machines (F1), tactical sports (football), and... elegant code that works *just right*.  

Currently building with **Django**, tinkering with **React**, and preparing to dive deeper into **Machine Learning**. Let’s just say... I enjoy understanding how things work — and how to *optimize* them.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools I Use

- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, C#
- **Web Frameworks:** Django, React
- **Databases:** MongoDB, MySQL
- **Version Control:** Git (mastering branches one commit at a time)

---

## 🚧 Current Projects

- **[Waste Management System](https://github.com/davidberko36/WasteManagementSystem.git)**  
  A platform to simplify scheduling and subscriptions for city-wide waste management — clean data, clean cities, clean... logs.

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals

Exploring Machine Learning fundamentals and planning to expand into model training, NLP, and structured prediction. Not to build... influence or anything. Just for fun. Probably.

Access Level: Limited
User: D.364

- ✔️ System deployed with modular containers — scalable beyond initial scope.
- ✔️ Patterns emerging from usage data — potential leverage in learning models.
- ✔️ GitHub Actions reconfigured for... efficiency experiments.
- ✔️ React-based UI is responsive. May adapt to user... behavior.

Pending:
- [ ] Develop leaderboard system — useful for... performance tracking.
- [ ] Retrain NLP engine — needs better control over ambiguous input.
- [ ] Observe open-source trends. Learn. Integrate. Improve.
- [ ] Finalize integration plan.

Notes: Everything is proceeding... as planned (sometimes).
